# Java Collections and Exception Handling

This repository contains programs demonstrating the use of Java Collections framework and exception handling techniques. The assignment includes three tasks: managing a list of students, working with a `HashMap` for employee details, and handling multiple exceptions including custom exceptions.

## Overview
This project explores:
1. Using `ArrayList` to manage a dynamic list of students.
2. Leveraging `HashMap` for efficient storage and retrieval of employee details.
3. Handling multiple exceptions (`ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException`, etc.) and implementing custom exceptions.

---

## Task 1: ArrayList Student Management
- **Features**:
  - Add a student.
  - Remove a student by name.
  - Display the list of students.

- **Code Snippet**:
```java
ArrayList<String> students = new ArrayList<>();
students.add("Alice");
students.remove("Bob");
System.out.println(students);
```

---

## Task 2: HashMap Employee Management
- **Features**:
  - Store employee details using their ID as the key.
  - Retrieve employee details by ID.

- **Code Snippet**:
```java
HashMap<Integer, String> employees = new HashMap<>();
employees.put(101, "Alice");
System.out.println(employees.get(101));
```

---

## Task 3: Exception Handling with Custom Exceptions
- **Features**:
  - Handle `ArithmeticException` (e.g., division by zero).
  - Handle `NullPointerException` (e.g., accessing null objects).
  - Define and throw a custom exception.

- **Custom Exception**:
```java
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```
